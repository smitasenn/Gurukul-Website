                        Shree Swaminarayan Vishvamangal Gurukul draws its vision, inspiration and strength
                        from the founder Shastri Swami Premswaroopdasji. Swamijij has dedicated his life as
                        religious
                        and spiritual Saint voluntarily and spending his life with an intention to make people free
                        from
                        evil clutches of negative influence of present era by maintaining the gesture of Sacrament
                        in
                        Society. He started his journey as a saint at very early age of life in the Swaminarayan
                        Mandir
                        located in Bhuj where he had spent 17 Years.
                        Swamiji says a Gujarati proverb “Sadhu to Chalta Bhala” which is implemented in his whole
                        journey of life. In 1985, Swamiji left Bhuj Swaminarayan Temple and arrived to Swaminarayan
                        Temple, Kalupur. After serving few years there Swamiji did Mahantai at Shree Swaminarayan
                        Temple, Narayanpura-Ahmedabad where he arranged Satsang Khathas in the surrounding towns and
                        villages which has given enlightenment to many followers. By the humble order of Acharya
                        Maharajshri, Swamiji moved to Shree Swaminarayan Mandir, Siddhpur. After development of
                        Siddhpur
                        Temple Swamiji came to Kalol, an entrance of North Gujarat Region and acquired a piece of
                        barren
                        land and dreamed to establish a gurukul providing education, shelter to helpless peoples and
                        a
                        Gaushala.
                        The first foundation stone was laid down by Param Pujya Dharm Dhurandhar 1008 Acharya Shri
                        Tejendraprasadji in the year 1992. Thereafter, Swamiji continued Satsang, Kathas and
                        religious
                        meetings in the nearby Towns and Villages. Then initially started giving education to few
                        students. Swamiji had started a School, then gradually he established various educational
                        institutes like B.Ed., PTC, Pharmacy, Diploma-Degree-Masters Engineering in Kalol campus.
                        Then
                        he established another branch of SSVG in Ranip-Ahmedabad where International School and
                        Physiotherapy institute were started. To provide quality health care facility Swamiji has
                        started hospital in Kalol campus followed that Medical and Paramedical courses have been
                        started. Moreover, through Swamiji’s vision Swaminarayan University came into existence from
                        1st
                        June, 2022. Swamiji strongly believes that an institution’s true strength lies in the hearts
                        and
                        souls of its teachers and students who come together with a purpose and firm determination
                        to
                        exchange the knowledge and let the whole society be the beneficiary.
